          <p>
            My name is <strong>Janine Blake</strong>, and I am the founder of Back on Track Counselling. I am a registered member of the <strong>British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (MBACP)</strong> and work in line with their ethical framework to provide safe, professional, and confidential counselling.
            I understand that reaching out for support can feel daunting, especially when you are feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or unsure where to begin. You do not need to have everything worked out before starting—counselling offers a space to explore what is going on for you, at a pace that feels right.
            I offer a warm, compassionate, and non-judgemental environment where you can talk openly and be met with empathy and understanding. Whether you are experiencing anxiety, low mood, stress, relationship difficulties, or feeling disconnected from yourself, our work will be centred around your individual needs.
            <strong>At Back on Track Counselling, my aim is to help you feel heard, supported, and empowered to reconnect with your strengths and move forward feeling more grounded and back on track.</strong>
